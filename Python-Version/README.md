### Fuzzy String Matching

We have a Edit Distance directory which contains the following algorithms :


* Recursive-Levenshtein -> Recursive implementation of [Levenshtein Distance] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
* Damerau-Levenshtein -> Dynamic Programming approach for implementation of [Damerau-Levenshtein Distance] (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerauâ€“Levenshtein_distance)
* Wagner-Fisher -> Dynamic Programming approach for implementation of [Levenshtein Distance] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm)
